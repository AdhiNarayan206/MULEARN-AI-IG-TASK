# AI Revolution & Weather Image Classifier

Welcome to this repository! This project explores the fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence and demonstrates a practical application using a custom-trained image classification model.

## 📚 Blog: The AI Revolution
This repository contains a comprehensive blog post explaining the core concepts of AI, including:
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The big picture.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Learning from experience.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: The brain mimic.
- **Data Science**: Extracting the gold.

You can read the full blog post in [blog.md](./blog.md).

## 🌤️ Project: Weather Image Classification
As a practical demonstration of Machine Learning, I have trained an image classification model to recognize different weather conditions (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy).

### Technologies Used
- **Teachable Machine**: Used to train the image classification model.
- **Image Dataset**: - [Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset)

### Watch the Demo
Check out the video below to see how the model was trained and how it performs:
